SUMMARY

Allergen is a mobile application for people who suffer from food allergies. It simplifies the process of safety-checking foods by identifying allergens in the ingredients. Users input their allergies and search for a food product, and the app cross-checks the product's ingredients against a database of the top 10 most popular allergies. Users are then shown a list of ingredients with the ones containing their allergens highlighted.

WHO ARE WE

We are students at Carnegie Mellon University studying Information Systems and Electrical and Computer Engineering. We created this project for the HealthHacks category at PennApps XIX.

TECH STACK

Allergen is developed with React Native, a cross-platform JavaScript framework. It relies on the USDA Database API to search for foods and retrieve authentic, up-to-date nutrition information. 

GOING FORWARD

Allergen is a useful tool that was born out of necessity (our teammate Jordan has wheat and corn allergies). As many as 15 million people in the U.S. alone are allergic to at least one food. All those people would benefit from a tool like Allergen. Therefore, this app has the potential to be more than a hackathon project. We plan to develop it further and eventually publish it.
